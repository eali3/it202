My client suggested I create an app that would make it easier for her to check the estimated time of arrival for the buses that are easily accessible from UIC, instead of searching for them on the CTA app each time. this app only saves and displays the ones the client uses frequently.
to keep it very simple the app has three tabs, about tab, bus tracker tab, a tab that fetches data and displays it in a table.
the about tab contains some information about the developer.
both the bus tracker and tracker tabs contain a hoverable table that displays 8 -10 frequent bus routes and stops and their estimated time of arrival.
The client really enjoys the simple interface, and says it saves her time and only shows what she needs.
